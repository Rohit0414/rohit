                <h1>description</h1>
                <p>News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: word of
                    mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of
                    observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from
                    soft media.

                    Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the
                    environment, economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual
                    events. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and
                    criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times.</p>

            <p>Stories that report only the most essential information in a concise and impartial manner are referred to
                as straight or hard news stories.This type of story typically follows the inverted pyramid style, which
                organizes information by descending order of importance or places the most newsworthy information at the
                beginning of the article. Examples of hard news
                stories include those about political topics and crime. </p> <a href="https://san.com/">read more</a>

            <h1>Enterprise Journalism.</h1>
            <p>Enterprise journalism reporting that is not generated by news or a press release, but rather generated by
                a reporter or news organization based on developed sources.[1]
                Tied to "shoe-leather" reporting and "beat reporting," enterprise journalism gets the journalist out of
                the office and away from the traditional news makers. It also enlists some of the traditional traits of
                good investigative reporting, such as reading documents.[2]</p> <a

            <p> Anna*, a hairdresser from Benin City in Nigeria, experienced abuse at the hands of her father. Unable to
                receive justice due to lack of strong evidence, she decided to flee. Tempted by promises of better
                economic opportunities, Anna embarked on an irregular migration journey, unaware of the dangers that
                awaited her.

                â€œIt was at my workplace that I got information [about migration].
